Release Schedule
================

Like the Linux Kernel, Ubuntu, and many other popular open source
projects, ZeroVM follows a time-based release schedule.

Releases are normally done in the beginning of each month. This
ensures that we get bugfixes and new features into the hands of users
as fast as possible.


.. _feature-releases:

Feature Releases
----------------

Every three months, we create a new feature release. This means that
you can expect to see a new feature release on these dates:

* Feb 1st
* May 1st
* Aug 1st
* Nov 1st


.. _bugfix-releases:

Bugfix Releases
---------------

We create a bugfix release every month. That way we can bring you
bugfixes in a timely fashion. When we have a feature release, the
bugfixes are released as part of that release. If there is a need for
it, we will create unscheduled bugfix releases.

What is ZeroCloud?
------------------

ZeroCloud is a middleware application for OpenStack Swift. ZeroCloud combines
the massively scalable object storage capabilities of Swift with the
application isolation provided by ZeroVM. The result is a platform which can be
used to create applications which are truly "cloud applications".
